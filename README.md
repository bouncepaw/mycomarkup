# Mycomarkup
**Mycomarkup** is a markup language designed to be used in [MycorrhizaWiki](https://mycorrhiza.lesarbr.es). This project is an attempt to separate the two and let mycomarkup be used stand-alone.

## Goals
Also see [our kanban board](https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycomarkup/projects/1).

* Provide a library that can be used with any Go program.
  * Ease of use is not a goal but it will be nice to have.
* Provide a CLI utility `mycomarkup`.

## Development
You will need the `stringer` tool â†“. Make sure it is in your `$PATH` or whatever.
```
go get -u -a golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer
```

Run `make` to do stuff.
