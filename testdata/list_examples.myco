## List examples
### Basic unordered flat list
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

### Basic ordered flat list
*. Item 1
*. Item 2
*. Item 3

### Basic to do list
*v Done
*x Not done
*v Done

### Multiline contents
* {
  //Any mycomarkup supported//

  * Other lists too
}
* This is single-line again

### Nesting lists
* As a shortcut for multiline contents with other lists only,
** you can use this syntax.
* You just have to
** increase
*** the amount of asterisks

### Mixing different types of lists
* This is from one list
*. But this is from a different one.
*v You can't mix them on one level

*v You can only mix
*x to do items

*. You can nest
** Items of different type
** But they have to be the same on one level

### Parsing approach
We read all list items of the same type and their contents (single-line or multi-line). The contents are parsed as if they were separate Mycomarkup documents.
